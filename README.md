# Hierarchical-Bayesian-Model

## Goal 
To understand how to build hierarchical bayesian models and apply MCMC (Markov Chain Mante Carlo) simulation to the models. 

The purpose of my project is to predict the transition between ages of players and pobability of homeruns. In order to do this, I made 3 different models.

## Data 
MLB (Major Leegue Baseball) dataset. You can find [here](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). 
There is a big dataset that includes various information such as teams, players of each team, pitching, batting and so on. 
I use only the batting and people datasets.
